# elite-box-contents-exporter
Utility that will take a box id as input and produce an excel spreadsheet containing a listing of the contents of a box in storage by querying the Elite Enterprise back-end sql server. 

Elite Enterprice does not have a box contents report, and the utility saves time in the Records department.
